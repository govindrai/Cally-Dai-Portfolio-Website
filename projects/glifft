          <h3 id="industry-research">Industry Research</h3>
          <p>We started off our process by analyzing popular companies in the on-demand gifting space to help us learn about best practices and learned behaviors. It also helped us think about Glifft’s unique value proposition and how we can properly give life to the idea in a frictionless way.</p>
          <p>We conducted an idea dump of the client’s idea and we listed our thoughts of features, desired behaviors, as well as concerns regarding the app. We narrowed in the concepts with highest potential and expanded on them.</p>

          <p>To ensure our persona is accurate, we should have conducted user interviews to validate the needs and the goals of our ideal user. However, since this is app has not yet been made and thus does not have a user base, we assumed 'Julia' to be true.</p>
          <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
          <p>With our ideas and persona in mind, we started the ideation process. After deliberating the uncertainty of direction, we listed out assumptions we had about users that would make this app successful. We then tested the riskiest one to make sure we were heading down the right direction.</p>
          <p>At this point, the app is only used when users have someone in mind to gift for. This assumes people have someone in mind often enough for everyday use of the app. We found users that matched our persona and tested how often they gave gifts. If the answer was more than twice a month, we considered it, ‘often.’</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>After asking 10 users, our hypothesis was rejected and we pivoted the structure of the app in order to heighten success. The best way to do this was to move the point of engagement up: instead of having someone in mind in order to use the app, users may also go into the app to browse items, which might inspire them to gift something they see. Displayed in the user story below.</p>

          <p>Evidently, the flow is very robust with many features in place. We later revised our scope on this project when we moved into building our prototype.</p>
          <h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
          <p>First, we piloted a branding workshop to stay true to Glifft’s identity. To do this more formally, we should have invited the founders in for their input. But since this was only for our own use, we operated just within our team.</p>
          <p>We started our branding workshop by pulling words from Glifft’s current branding and inspirations. We also revisited companies from our research and listed words that resonated with us.</p>
        </div><img class="project-body-image" src="../images/word cloud.jpg" width="80%">
        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>We bundled similar words and kept doing so until we came up with 4 key brand attributes.</p>
        </div><img class="project-body-image" src="../images/word cloud clustered.jpg" width="80%"><img class="project-body-image" src="../images/brand attributes.png" width="80%">
        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>With these in mind, we had guidelines for choosing typefaces and color palettes. Ultimately we chose Avenir and various shades of a single accent colors for simplicity.</p>
        </div><img class="project-body-image" src="../images/type and color.png" width="80%">
        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>At this point, our low-fidelity mockups required a hefty app that was out of scope even for our very large team. In order for us to work at a more agile pace, we decided to focus our attention on the main functions of the app. Our biggest concern was to solve today’s problems with the simplest solution possible.</p>
          <p>We began to simplify and streamline our processes, which allowed us to move quickly through the development of our prototype by dividing and conquering designing the high-fidelity screens. By having frequent meetings, we were able to touch base often and stay cohesive in our work. See below for some examples of the changes we made.</p>

          <h3 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>With our prototype set, we started testing our prototype with people who matched our persona, Julia. We asked 7 users comprehension questions to test the intuitiveness of the interface, and led them through usability tasks to test the flow and interactions of the app.</p>

          <p>Overall the function and aesthetic of the prototype was well received. However there were some key features we needed to change, including the structure of the three main tabs, some iconography, and a couple of cosmetic changes. See below for examples.</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>To make sure these changes work to our advantage, we would need to test the new prototype with at least another 7 users. However, because of our timeframe, we delivered the changes without testing, making sure to let our client know that their next step should be to test the new prototype.</p>
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>The final mockups were given to the client, along with our low-fidelity wireframes that mapped out additional features to the app. We also made aware the following as next steps to the client:</p>
          <p>1. Test changes to see if the results from user testing and comprehension improves
            <br>2. Perform card sorting&nbsp;to test information hierarchy and&nbsp;reassess tab bar navigation if necessary
            <br>3.&nbsp;Build out other features of the app to be consistent with the simple and clean aesthetic</p>
          <p>The Glifft team was tremendously grateful and impressed with the work that we put in to the project and is currently working with engineers to bring our designs to life!</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Working in a team of 11 designers was challenging for various reasons. I learned to work with everyone’s differing opinions by listening more than speaking. The finished product that comes from combined ideas is more powerful than any one person’s idea on its own. I also learned to properly allocate time in discussions and move through topics thoroughly but efficiently.</p>
          <p>Throughout this project, I also learned how to communicate with clients that were founders and engineers. The Glifft team was very curious, involved, and supportive. However, sometimes their high investment and inquisition called for us to go beyond our scope. We learned to be respectfully firm and honest in our communications in order not to overwork our team.</p>
