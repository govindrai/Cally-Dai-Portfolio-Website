          <h2>Project&nbsp;Summary&nbsp;</h2>
          <p>Canopy is an educational platform dedicated to teaching people about trading stocks.</p>
          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>Responsive mobile website.</p>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>Canopy currently lacks engagement with its users through their lesson and progress flow. We aim to create a course roadmap and introduce interactive components within lessons.</p>
          <h4>Constraints</h4>
          <p>10-week timeline, confined to limited content with ability to scale.</p>
          <h4>Role</h4>
          <p>Product Designer with 6 other designers.</p>
          <h4>Process</h4>

          <p>Before the course roadmap and lesson pages were sterile, with no opportunities for engagement. We changed that by introducing a clear progressive roadmap, bite-sized lessons, and interactive quizzes throughout the lesson. See details for before and after below.

          <h3 id="persona-development">Persona Development</h3>
          <p>Since Canopy was newly launched, it was still exploring specifics of its ideal user base. We did not have concrete data so we predicted what kind of user would be ideal for the product with a provisional persona.</p>

          <p>To ensure our persona held some accuracy, we conducted user interviews with people who used Canopy or had an interest to learn stock-trading. We validated their behaviors and needs for learning stocks, and asked them comprehension questions regarding their learning styles and previous experiences.</p>
        </div><img class="project-body-image" src="../images/IMG_7283.jpg" width="80%">
        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>We found 4 key insights from this process:</p>
          <p>1. Users wanted short, bite-sized lessons when learning new material
            <br>2.&nbsp;Users wanted elements of interactivity within the lesson to keep them engaged
            <br>3. Users wanted structure to their learning process
            <br>4.&nbsp;Users were unsure what level they were considered regarding knowledge of material</p>
          <h3 id="industry-research">Industry Research</h3>
          <p>We also started researching best practices for the learning platform industry. We examined successful models, such as Duolingo and Codecademy, to discover which attributes they had in common and to figure out which methodologies were considered most effective.</p>
        </div><img class="project-body-image" src="../images/IMG_4302.jpg" width="80%">
        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>We noted pros and cons for each platform and agreed upon which we thought had potential to be best suited for Canopy.</p>
          <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
          <p>With our persona’s needs and industry inspirations in mind, we started our extended version of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures Design Sprint</a>. Normally, this whole process would be conducted in a week, but instead, we spanned this over the course of a couple weeks.</p>
          <p>We started with an idea dump of all possible directions we can take in order to create an engaging learning platform for users. We listed out our ideas and narrowed in on the best and most feasible ideas. We further narrowed our scope to what we wanted to accomplish for the primary version of the web application.</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>Next, we moved on to Crazy 8’s, an activity where we sketched 8 lo-fi variations of our design ideas in 5 minutes. We did this on the primary screens we were going to focus on: the course roadmap and the lesson page, focusing on designing&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first">mobile first</a>.</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>We gathered insight from each other’s work and continued on to sketch out a full-page layout, one for the roadmap and one for the lesson. I decided to focus on the lesson page, and helped create the baseline for the final product.</p>
          <h3 id="prototype">Prototype</h3>
          <p>We started our prototyping process by first diverging and creating 3 separate wireframe designs for the course roadmap and the lesson page.</p>

          <p>We came together to ensure the two ideas flowed cohesively and that all UI elements were&nbsp;scaleable to desktop web.</p>
          <p>We populated our mockups with dummy information and created a mid-fidelity prototype using Pixate.</p>
          <h3 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>We tested our prototype with 6 users. Although 7 users would have provided more statistical significance, the result from testing 6 users was enough to inform our next steps in the process. We walked users through completing a lesson in our prototype, and asked them a couple of comprehension questions.</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>Unfortunately, most of the confusion from our&nbsp;users came from misunderstanding the dummy content&nbsp;in the prototype. We immediately&nbsp;remedied this by using more relevant copy and iconography in our next iteration.</p>
          <p>Despite this, there were some aspects that went incredibly well: all users understood it was a learning platform, knew how to start a lesson, and liked the interactivity within the lesson. For everything else, we mapped out all the pain points we needed to address for our next iteration.</p>

          <p>Before our next round of testing, we split up and made the appropriate changes to our prototype from the results of our first testing. To combat the confusion with our dummy copy and iconography, we also took our designs into high fidelity.</p>
          <p>For consistency, we tested another group of 6 users.</p>

        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p>These results were much more agreeable and from here, we only made minor changes to our prototype before the final deliverable.</p>
          <p>One thing we had to unquestionably address was our “cheat sheet.”&nbsp;Although our comprehension testing told us users enjoyed the idea of having a lesson summary, “cheat sheet” was indecipherable to users. We decided to simply rename this as “lesson summary” for our next iteration.</p>

          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>We handed our work over to the Canopy team, including secondary login and profile screens to complete the ecosystem. For next steps, we encouraged the team to:</p>
          <p>1. Conduct another round of testing using “lesson summary” instead of “cheat sheet” to confirm users' understanding
            <br>2. Arrange lessons by topic to resonate with users who do not know their level of knowledge
            <br>3. Build out other pages, including the login and profile pages, to match the look and feel of the new platform</p>
          <p>The Canopy is now working on implementing the changes we have proposed, and you can check it out&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canopytrading.com/">here</a>!</p>
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Working on Canopy taught me how to thrive working in ambiguous circumstances. Being a very early stage product, the founders were very flexible. Although this made them extremely receptive to our ideas, it was challenging optimizing designs for an indistinct product. Ultimately, we learned how to&nbsp;ask for concrete answers to narrow the scope of our solutions.</p>
          <p>Working with clients also&nbsp;taught me how to effectively communicate design decisions. I learned to be careful not to use jargon and to explain only things in ways non-designers can digest. Additionally, it is most helpful to limit options as to not overwhelm them and to have conviction as we deliver the final result. Ultimately, the client trusted us with design decisions, so we took the lead and spoke with confidence.</p>
